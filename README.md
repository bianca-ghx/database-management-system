# Database Management System

This project was developed for the Description and Retrieval of Audiovisual Content course at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. 
The input data consists of the [Kaggle Goodreads Books dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks). The purpose of this project is to implement a library database 
management system, using MySQL for working with the database and PyQt5 for the GUI.
